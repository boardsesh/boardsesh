/**
 * "This board_climb_stats row carries real catalog data" — the single predicate
 * behind the MoonBoard wrong-angle fix (#3529).
 *
 * A stats row at a given (board_type, climb_uuid, angle) either holds something
 * only an upstream catalog could have supplied, or it holds nothing but
 * Boardsesh-derived counts. The four columns below are the ones no Boardsesh
 * code path writes on a CATALOG climb:
 *
 *   - upstream_ascensionist_count  — the manufacturer's own repeat count
 *   - display_difficulty           — the catalog grade
 *   - benchmark_difficulty         — the catalog benchmark grade
 *   - upstream_quality_average     — the manufacturer's star average
 *
 * "On a catalog climb" is the load-bearing qualifier, not decoration. Two
 * Boardsesh writers do set display_difficulty / benchmark_difficulty:
 * saveMoonBoardClimb (packages/backend/src/graphql/resolvers/climbs/mutations.ts)
 * and the web saveClimb proxy's saveClimbStats('moonboard', …)
 * (packages/web/app/api/v1/[board_name]/proxy/saveClimb/route.ts). Both write
 * them only for a climb they are creating, and both create that climb with a
 * non-null board_climbs.user_id — and every consumer of this predicate consults
 * it strictly behind the user-created fence (bc.user_id IS NULL), so neither
 * writer's rows are ever reached through it. If that ever stopped holding, the
 * failure direction is protective: an extra TRUE reads as "real catalog data",
 * and the fix responds by declining to move the tick or delete the row.
 *
 * The tick recompute never writes any of the four (see the recompute module doc),
 * so a row where all four are absent is provably an artefact of a tick landing at
 * that angle — a phantom row — rather than a graded angle of the problem.
 *
 * Why the whole fix hangs on this rather than on bare row existence: under
 * MoonBoard's current identity model one physical problem is TWO board_climbs
 * rows (uuidv5 of `moonboard:{id}:{angle}`), so a tick logged from a board set
 * to the other angle strands itself at an angle the climb is not graded at, and
 * the recompute then mints a stats row there. That phantom row IS the bug — so a
 * predicate that only asked "is there a stats row at this angle?" would answer
 * "yes" for every affected climb in prod and the fix would never fire. Testing
 * for catalog data instead makes the code fix work on the existing damage, not
 * just on damage yet to be created.
 *
 * Reused verbatim by:
 *   - resolveMoonBoardTickAngle (queries/climbs/moonboard-tick-angle.ts)
 *   - both recompute seed guards (climb-stats/recompute.ts)
 *   - migration 0188_moonboard_wrong_angle_stats_cleanup.sql (statements A and B
 *     share it, so A can never strand a row B then refuses to delete)
 *
 * Keep the three copies in step. Adding a column that an upstream catalog owns
 * means adding it here, in the raw-SQL twin below, and in the migration.
