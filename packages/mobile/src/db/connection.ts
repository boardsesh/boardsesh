 * everything is cleared or nothing is. Rows and the markers describing them dying
 * together is the load-bearing part — a marker outliving its rows is the
 * unrecoverable direction (see deleteAllSyncMeta), because a surviving

 * board, and a surviving checkpoint would make the strict `>` delta pull resume past
 * rows that are gone.
 *
 * Any pending mutations that had not yet reached the server are discarded here along
 * with their local rows — sign-out is an explicit "this account is done on this
 * device" signal, so dropping unsynced writes is the documented behaviour rather than
 * a data-loss bug. The manual sign-out path drains the queue best-effort first and
 * warns about whatever is left (useConfirmSignOut).
 *
 * The caller MUST have aborted in-flight pulls first — a page already on the wire
 * would otherwise land after the delete and resurrect part of a catalog, complete
 * with a checkpoint past it. AuthProvider's setSigningOut(true) does that (it bumps
 * the monotonic wipe epoch that every long-running pull re-checks across its awaits)
