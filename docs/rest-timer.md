# Rest timer

The mobile rest timer (#5378) counts a climber's rest between climbs and, when they ask for it,
moves the wall to the next climb when the rest runs out. This page covers the three seams every
timer feature plugs into: what the timer is paced by, how it tells the climber the rest is ending,
and which phone may move the wall. The workout stages that pace it are in
`docs/workout-stages.md`.

## Where the code lives

| Piece | File |
| --- | --- |
| Runtime state (armed, anchor, cycle id). Module store, nothing persisted | `packages/mobile/src/lib/rest-timer-store.ts` |
| Deadline maths, the stale-deadline guard | `packages/mobile/src/lib/rest-timer-auto-advance.ts` |
| The one `setTimeout` that fires the advance | `packages/mobile/src/components/queue-control/RestTimerAutoAdvanceScheduler.tsx` |
| The pill, the hero clock and their 1 Hz ticker | `packages/mobile/src/components/queue-control/RestTimerPill.tsx` |
| The options sheet and the Record tab's arm row | `RestTimerSheet.tsx`, `session-screen/RestTimerArmRow.tsx` |
| Effective pacing | `packages/mobile/src/lib/rest-timer-pacing.ts`, `src/hooks/use-effective-rest-pacing.ts` |
| Cues | `packages/mobile/src/lib/rest-timer-cues.ts`, `src/lib/sounds.ts` |
| Wall-driver rule | `packages/mobile/src/lib/session-timer/driver-rule.ts`, `src/hooks/use-session-timer-driver.ts` |

The durable preferences (rest length, cadence, auto-advance, sound, countdown cues) live in
`packages/mobile/src/settings`. Arming never survives a cold start.

## Effective pacing

The timer runs on an `EffectiveRestPacing`: a rest length, a cadence (`afterTick` or
`onTheMinute`), an auto-advance switch, an advance rule and the source it came from.
`resolveEffectiveRestPacing` picks the source, highest first:

1. `crew`: the session's shared clock (#5382).
2. `stage`: the workout stage the current climb belongs to (#5380, #6231). A stage always
   auto-advances.
3. `settings`: the climber's own preferences. These never carry an advance rule, so they run on
   the deadline, as the timer always has.

`useEffectiveRestPacing()` (and `getEffectiveRestPacing()` outside React) is the only way to read
it. The scheduler, the pill and hero clock, `RestTimerSessionSync` and the arm row read through
it today; the tick path, the workout runner, the crew publisher and the Lock Screen countdown join
as they land. A new source changes `rest-timer-pacing.ts` and the hook, never those readers. The
sheet's controls keep writing the settings directly: they edit the climber's preferences, not the
effective value.

Today only `settings` is wired, so the hook returns exactly the three settings with
`advanceOn: 'deadline'` and `source: 'settings'`.

The advance rule:

| Rule | A finished rest moves the wall when | After the move, an `afterTick` rest |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `deadline` | always | starts again at the fire |
| `tick` | a tick was logged on the climb on the wall | waits for the next tick |
| `send` | that tick was a flash or a send | waits for the next tick |

`onTheMinute` keeps its beat whatever the rule (`anchorAfterFire`). `restAdvanceAllowed` is the
pure check; it only lets a tick count when it was logged against the queue item on the wall, so a
tick on the previous climb, or one from a list, never lights the next.

## Cues

The scheduler names a moment and `playRestTimerCue` decides what it feels and sounds like:

| Cue | When | Haptic | Sound |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `countdownTick` | each of the last seconds | selection | tick |
| `warning` | once before an auto-advance, when per-second cues are off | light | tick |
| `advance` | the scheduler called `nextClimb()` | medium | final |
| `reached` | the rest ran out and the wall did not move | success | final |

`warning`, `advance` and `reached` are the timer's original three haptics, unchanged.
`countdownTick` arrives with the countdown (#5396).

Rules the scheduler keeps:

- One terminal cue per deadline: `advance` when `nextClimb()` ran, `reached` when the rest ran
  out and the wall did not move. One gap today: at a dead end (the end of the queue or the list)
  the toast is the only signal, so that deadline plays no terminal cue. The countdown PR (#5396)
  closes it in the reached region it owns; until then a scheduler test pins the gap, so the change
  is deliberate.
- Countdown ticks and the single `warning` never both play for one rest.
- `playRestTimerCue` never throws. The haptic always plays. The sound plays only when
  `isRestTimerSoundAvailable()` and the `restTimerSound` setting are both true, and the player is
  built on the first cue that wants it and kept while it works. One that throws is dropped, so
  the next cue builds a fresh one.

## Sound (native train)

On `main` there is no sound: `packages/mobile/src/lib/sounds.ts` is a placeholder whose
`isSoundSupported()` returns false and `createSoundPlayer()` returns null, so every cue is the
haptic alone and the Sound setting row stays hidden. Playing a sound needs `expo-audio`, a native
module, so the body ships in a `[native-train]` PR on `release/next` (#5395). Only that PR edits
this section and `sounds.ts`.

## Which phone moves the wall

`deriveSessionTimerDriver` is the one rule, read through `useSessionTimerDriver()`:

| Role | When | May advance the queue |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `solo` | no crew in the session | yes, with or without a board connected |
| `holder` | a crew, and this phone holds the wall | yes |
| `passenger` | a crew, and a crewmate holds the wall | no, `blockedReason: 'crewPassenger'`, `pacerDisplayName` names the holder |
| `unheld` | a crew, and nobody holds the wall | no, `blockedReason: 'crewPassenger'` |

The scheduler fires only where `canAdvanceQueue` is true, and the sheet's auto-advance switch is
disabled with the reason everywhere else, so the two can never disagree.

"A crew" is `useIsCrewSession()`: someone else is on the session roster, past the arming dwell.
It is the same roster rule as `useIsSharedSession()` without the `shared-session-browse` flag.
That flag decides how gestures behave in a crew. It never decides who may move the wall: with the
flag off, every armed phone in a crew used to be able to advance it.

`canDriveGymTimer` is the Rogue gym timer's gate and keeps its old answer: this phone holds the
board's Bluetooth link. A virtual hold on a wall with no lights never widens it, so a phone
without the LED link never scans for the timer.

## Settings

| Key | Default | Read by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `restTimerTargetSeconds` | Off | effective pacing |
| `restTimerMode` | `afterTick` | effective pacing |
| `restTimerAutoAdvance` | off | effective pacing |
| `restTimerSound` | on | `playRestTimerCue`, on a binary that can play sound |
| `restTimerCountdownCues` | on | the countdown (#5396) |

## Who edits what

Several PRs change these files at once, so each owns its region:

| File or section | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| `rest-timer-pacing.ts`, `use-effective-rest-pacing.ts` | the seam PR; the workout pacing PR adds the stage input, the crew PR the crew input |
| `rest-timer-cues.ts`, `driver-rule.ts` and their hooks | the seam PR |
| `sounds.ts` and the `## Sound (native train)` section | the native train PR only, until the merge-back |
| Scheduler: the pacing and driver reads, the cue calls | the seam PR |
| Scheduler: the fire's anchor and the advance-rule check | the workout pacing PR |
| Scheduler: the warning, reached and keep-awake region | the countdown PR |
| Scheduler: the fire's crew compare-and-set, the AppState effect | the crew PR |
| `RestTimerSheet.tsx` lines the release train changed | nobody on `main` until the merge-back |
| A `## Countdown` section, directly above `## Settings` | the countdown PR |
| `## Settings`, and a Timers page section directly after it | the Timers page PR |
| The session timer and Rogue sections, directly above `## Who edits what` | the Rogue timer PR |

New sections go at those anchors, never at the end of the file and never against
`## Sound (native train)`. The Release Train Sync merges `main` into `release/next` on every push
to `main` and hourly, and git reads a `main` edit that touches the train's lines, or sits directly
against them, as a conflict. One untouched line between the two edits is enough for a clean merge.
